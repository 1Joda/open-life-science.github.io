title: Week 1 - Meet your mentor!
---

**Date**: Week of January 20, 2020

**Duration**: 30 minutes

# This week

This is your first meeting with your OLS mentor. This call should include you and your mentor. If you are working on a team of up to (and no more than) 3 registered participants, you can all meet together with your mentor.

These 30-minute meetings will happen every other week during OLS. The default time is during your cohort call time. Your mentor will reach out to you this week to confirm when and where you'll be meeting.

In your first meeting with your mentor, introduce yourselves and then:
- Make sure you have your GitHub account set up
- Review your self-assessment
- Set 1-2 personal open science goals for yourself
- Set 1-2 open culture goals for your community, organization, or project

Document your goals in your shared notes; you will return to these goals frequently to assess your progress towards meeting them.

# Resources

- ["Get your project online"](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/) from Mozillaâ€™s [Open leadership Training Series (OLTS)](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/).

# Before this meeting

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Complete **your own copy** of the [open leadership self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQgdfj4lPnypAyb9_Ba0Zt7E8J5L6qMvuKwu0wgQsjs/edit?usp=sharing) and share it to your mentor

    If you're a group, each teammate should complete this assessment individually. This is here to help you set your own personal goals during the program. No need to share your results, but be ready to share your thoughts with your mentor.

- Make sure you know when and how you'll be meeting with your mentor

# After this meeting

- Create an issue on the [OLS-1 GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-1/issues/new) for your OLS work and share the link to your mentor
- Draft a brief vision statement using your goals

    [This lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/) from the Open Leadership Training Series (OLTS) might be helpful
