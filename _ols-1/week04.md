title: Week 4 - Tooling and roadmapping for Open projects
---

**Date**: Week of February 10, 2020

**Time**: TBA

**Duration**: 90 minutes

# This week

During this week's cohort call, we will:
- look at project structure as we build open projects
- go over the standard files in open projects
    - README
    - LICENSE
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - issues and labels in GitHub
    
    The exact project structure and files used may look different on your project.

This will be followed by an optional 1 hour GitHub tutorial.

# Resources

# Before this meeting

- Look up two other projects and comment on their GitHub issues with feedback on their open canvas

# After this meeting

- Use your canvas to start writing a README, or landing page, for your project
- Add or update a [README file](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) in your GitHub repository with any new information about your OLS work that you want to include.
- Add an [open license](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/sharing-your-work-in-the-open/) to your repository as a file called LICENSE.
- Link to your README in a comment on your GitHub issue.
- Add a code of conduct to your repository
- Vision stand brainstorm prep

    Be prepared to get feedback in a small group on a 2min vision stand on your project in Week 6. If you're not sure where to start, use this [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVBI31m9lm9CFNyZw61aN9dMzE6J4oXmH-iY80muHl8/edit?usp=sharing) to brainstorm
