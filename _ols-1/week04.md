# This week

During this week's cohort call, we will:
- look at project structure as we build open projects
- go over the standard files in open projects
    - README
    - LICENSE
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
    - issues and labels in GitHub
    
    The exact project structure and files used may look different on your project.

This will be followed by an optional 1 hour GitHub tutorial.
