# The OLS-1 program
{:.no_toc}

**Purpose**: Training for early stage researchers and young leaders interested in furthering their
Open Science skills

**Outcome**: Ambassadors for Open Science practice, training and education across multiple European
and international bioinformatics communities.

**Process**: A 15-week mentoring & training program, based on the [Mozilla Open Leader program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), helping participants in becoming Open Science ambassadors by using three principles:

1. **Sharing** essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project.
2. **Connecting** members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by creating space in this program for them to share their experiences and expertise.
3. **Empowering** them to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities.

# Goals and Learning Objectives

The vision of Open Life Science program is to strengthen Open Science skills for early stage researchers and young leaders in life science.

At the end of the program, our participants will be able to:
- Describe and define the terms *openness*, *open science*, *open leadership*, *community interactions*, *value exchanges*, *inclusivity*, *accessibility*, *open Science practices in developing resources and training*
- Learn how to apply those principles to open leadership and working open in their projects and communities
. Learn how to collect, invite, and tell stories that demonstrate how and why openness benefits the communities they serve
- Give original examples for the types of openness in science
- Design
  - Illustrate the need for a project, its vision, and its goals
  - Embrace and communicate the benefits of Open Science and how to strategically apply different open practices to their work
  - Identify the public resources to share their data
  - Identify the different type of Open Access and associated journals
- Build
  - Start any project with openness in mind from day one
  - Setup a project repository on GitHub using best practices for enabling collaboration
  - Choose and apply open licenses appropriately
- Empower
  - Create and enforce a safe working environment
  - Promote the values of Open Science to empower others to lead and collaborate
  - Include a broad range of contributors in their work
  - Communicate their work and vision in a 2min demo of elevator pitch
- Lead an open project in science

# Joining calls

**Cohort and mentor-only calls**: The calls will be hosted online using the Zoom web-conferencing option.

  Link for the calls will be shared for each meeting separately.

**Mentee-mentor calls**: You can use the online communication options that both mentor and mentee agree to use. A few options to explore are the following:
- Zoom: 40 mins limit for each call
- Google hangout: Free for members with google account
- Skype: Free, download the app
- Whereby.com: Free option, valid upto 4 participants

**If you can't make it to a call**:
- If you have to miss a call, please write your name in the cohort note under "apologies".

  The cohorts calls will be recorded each week and sent out with the review emails.

- If you miss two or more calls during the program, we'll evaluate if you would be able to finish the program.
- If a mentor has to miss a mentee-mentor meeting, please discuss it with your mentee and reschedule your call. 

  If you are unable to make it to any slot together, please find other ways (asynchronous documentation) to interact with your mentee.

# Mentoring training

Mentors advice and inspire
- Connect: to people, programs, companies
- Recommend: resources, readings, classes, experiences
- Feedback: for the mentee to consider

Becoming a mentor can be frightening. Mentors will be then guided specially via a mentoring training with 4 calls. Our mentors will gain mentoring skills (active listening, effective questioning, giving feedback) via mentoring training to learn to celebrate successes and approach challenges in mentoring.
