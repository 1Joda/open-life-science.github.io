# Year one of Open Life Science (OLS) - Part 2

This is part 2 of the OLS project and community health report: **Where we are**

### Cohort expense and cost - and its shoestring budget 

Our website helps to give us an incredibly professional face thanks to Bérénice’s tireless and utterly incredible efforts (including during her maternity leave). But, as shiny as our site might look, we’re still operating on a shoestring budget - most of the preparation work we do is out of hours and on our own time, and many of the expenses required to run this project effectively have come from the founders’ own pockets. Likewise, OLS mentors and experts are all currently unpaid. 

We would like to make this more sustainable - as such it probably comes as no surprise that the OLS team is currently actively seeking funding and applying for external fund sources. 

Two co-founders are fellows of the Software Sustainability Institute (UK), which provided small fellowship funds with which we manage to support the communication and application management platforms required for the program. We are grateful to receive personal and organisational support in redirecting this fellowship towards OLS infrastructure needs. However, claiming these expenses can sometimes be a challenge -- not all items can be funded and administrative formalities and a blog post is required for each item funded. As much as we like publishing written content from each activity we do, we’ve unfortunately become extremely time-poor whilst running a non-profit organisation outside of our day jobs.

**Budget**: Estimated real cost for 1 cohort (4 months): GBP £25,000 in founder, mentor, and expert time, as well as some infrastructure costs.

For one cohort in 2021, OLS was awarded EOSC-life (https://www.eosc-life.eu/) open call training funding of up to 20,000 Euros to develop a special call to train and mentor up to 15 projects from within the EOSC-life research infrastructure. This will partially cover costs for OLS-3.  This call for applications will be designed over the next few months, widening the accessibility of our service and resources within the European research community. Thanks to Neil Chue Hong, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, Mateusz Kuzak, Andrew Stewart, Naomi Penfold, Fotis E. Psomopoulos, and Emmy Tsang for providing references and generous testimonials about the program. You can find a copy of our grant application  on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4060367).

## OLS-1 to OLS-2 - cohort doubled in size

The post-cohort survey from the first round was overwhelmingly positive, despite the fact that most of the training and project development took place during the lockdown. 

[The graduation calls were live-streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wuy56LcHEw&list=PL1CvC6Ez54KB6U9GtjOjwESMurHgT41qM) and reports were shared widely through social media. As a result, more members with interest and expertise in Open Science reached out to join the next cohort.

Many of those projects have established themselves as valuable resources in their communities (short report: https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/05/27/ols1-wrapup/). Particularly, our heartiest congratulations to the [Bioinformatics HUB of Kenya](https://bioinformaticshubofkenya.wordpress.com/) project, who with incubator funding provided by OLS-1 has successfully established itself as a non-profit organisation in Kenya. 


In OLS-2, a total of 32 projects by a group of 52 mentees were selected, which is a ~50% increase in project numbers and participants over the previous cohort. These project leads will be trained and mentored between September and December of 2020 with the support of 32 mentors and 67 members in the expert community. These members represent several countries from 6 continents and will advance the knowledge of Open Science in their communities. 6 projects from The Turing Way affiliated with The Alan Turing Institute (https://www.turing.ac.uk/) joined the project in the second cohort (https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#collaborators). Through this collaboration, the international community of The Turing Way will be able to access mentoring and training support through OLS. Read more details about this cohort in [this blog post](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/09/01/ols2-announcement/).

We continue to invite feedback from our participants to ensure that they feel adequately supported and find their experience of working with OLS mutually rewarding. We encourage participants to develop their projects on their GitHub repositories and share with others in the program through a centralised GitHub-based issue tracker. They comment on each other's project-issues and take notes in shared HackMds. We encourage our participants in sharing their ideas and skills with each other through issue tracker and HackMD notes. Nevertheless, we would create opportunities for people outside the cohort to support OLS resources as maintainers and invite reviews of PRs that can benefit from feedback from members outside the leadership. We have also created a pathway for our graduates to return as mentors and experts (many OLS-1 graduates have returned to OLS-2) and continue to gain support from the OLS even after they have finished their training.
