We are thrilled to announce that [29 members](https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/#participants), who are the project leads of [20 diverse projects](https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/#projects), have joined the first cohort of the Open Life Science mentoring program - OLS-1!

### Meet our mentees!

The mentees joining this program are **Elisenda Bonet-Carne, Deborah Akuoko, Chiara Bertipaglia, Festus Nyasimi, Margaret Wanjiku, David Kiragu Mwaura, Michael Kofia Landi, Billy (William) Broderick, Bruno Eleres Soares, Naraiana Loureiro Benone, Sudarshan GC., Himanshu Singh, Lilian Juma, Renato Alves, Cassandra Gould van Praag, Anunya Opasawatchai, David Chentanaman, Elsa Loissel, Zoe Chervontseva, Matúš Kalaš, Seun Oyemomi, Kristina Riemer, David LeBauer, Emily Cain, Jorge Barrios, Christine Rogers, Sandy Kawano, Samuel Guay, and Lena Karvovskaya**. All these project leaders are based in different African, Asian, European, Latin American, North American, and Russian countries where they will be leading their respective projects. We are excited to welcome these members who are not only located in different parts of the world, but also represent different identities and backgrounds, aim to address a wide range of questions in their field, and are motivated to bring a culture change in their areas.

Their project range from the ideas of creating new local communities, promoting best practices in open science in their existing communities, developing open software, enhancing and promoting science communication, learning community skills, improving documentation for sustainability, building open education resources, or providing support to open practitioners in their network. Many of them are long-standing Open Scientists who aim to use this opportunity to apply “Open by Design” principle in their projects through this program. One member, Renato Alves, is a mentee of a project but is also mentoring one of the other projects. The project of Lena Karvovskaya was transferred from the eLife Innovation Program as it fits better with the goal and scope of the OLS program. 

### Meet our mentors!

They will be supported in this program by our mentors’ community who have been assigned to each of them based on the compatibility of expertise and interests of mentors with the requests and requirements of our mentees. Our mentors are Open Science champions with previous experience in training and mentoring. They are currently working in different professions in data science, publishing, community building, software development, clinical studies, industries, scientific training and IT services. 

We welcome our mentors, **Aidan Budd, Andrew Stewert, Björn Grüning, Caleb Kibet, Daniela Saderi, Fotis Psomopoulos, Hao Ye, Harry Smith, Holger Dinkel, Katrin Leinweber, Luis Pedro Coelho, Mateusz Kuzak, Naomi Penfold, Patricia, Renato Alves, Rodrigo Oliveira Campos, Toby Hodges, Venkata Satagopam, Vicky Nembaware**. Yo and Malvika will also mentor one project each in this cohort. We are extremely grateful to them for their support and contributions to OLS and their impactful work in other open communities. They are committed to supporting their mentees in this program and help create a more open and fair research and knowledge sharing culture within life science.

We will begin our program this week with a mentoring training call, and mentor-mentee introductions. Check out the complete schedule and plans for OLS-1 here: https://openlifesci.org/ols-1.

You can keep track of our program, the progress of our first cohort and future announcements by following our twitter profile [@openlifesci](https://twitter.com/openlifesci) or joining our [community Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/open-life-sci/community).

We invite new contributions to the program as a [new issue on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/open-life-science/open-life-science.github.io/issues) or by [email to the team](mailto:team@openlifesci.org).

Once again, let’s welcome our mentors and mentees to this program!
