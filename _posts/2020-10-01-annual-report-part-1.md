# Year one of Open Life Science (OLS) - Part 1

Around June 2019, OLS was originally dreamed up. Mozilla had launched a call for applications to [Open Leaders X](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/mozilla-open-leaders/), the program that incubated OLS and several other related open leadership initiatives. In July 2019, we submitted a collaboratively prepared application written at the [BOSC 2019 CoFest](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc/about/2019/) (see [the draft](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2019/09/24/application/)), and in September we were delighted to learn we had been accepted to create our program as a part of Open Leaders X. Slightly more than a year has now passed, and we would like to share the first **annual OLS project and community report** with you.

Since the report is quite elaborative, we are publishing them in 3 parts: 
1. we start by looking back at where we started
1. we give an account of how far we have come 
1. we end this report with where we want to go. 

*This is the first part of the report: **Where we started***

### OLS timeline so far

- **September 2019**: OLS team joined Mozilla Open Leaders X as an accepted project
- **October 2019**: OLS is launched at [MozFest 2019](https://medium.com/mozilla-festival/mozfest-2019-highlights-b8084b8b64b2) with 30 mentors and 40 experts
- **November 2019**: OLS-1 call for application opens 
- **January 2020**: OLS-1 launched with 22 participating projects 
- **May 2020**: OLS-1 graduates - 29 applicants graduated across 20 projects
- **July 2020**: OLS-2 call for application opens
- **September 2020**: OLS-2 launched with 32 participating projects
- **December 2020**: OLS-2 expected graduation
- **January 2021**: OLS-3 call for application is expected to open

## Inclusiveness designed at the core of OLS

We designed our project to be inclusive of different demographics, by intentionally targeting researchers from countries, identities and genders who are traditionally underrepresented in Open Science (thanks to [166 members in OLS community](https://openlifesci.org/community)). We personally reached out to all the mentors and experts from diverse domain knowledge, personal backgrounds and identities. Our current [mentors](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#mentors) represent scientific communities from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, UK, and the USA. Our [expert cimmunity](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#experts) is double in both size and representation. We started our [first cohort](https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/) with mentees who came from equally diverse countries from 5 continents, representing low, middle and high economy countries equally. [29 individuals](https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/#participants) joined from Kenya, Netherlands, Brazil, Canada, Thailand, Spain, UK, Japan, Russian, India, USA, Norway, Germany, and Nepal. Our mentors represented research communities from China, Greece, the UK, the USA, South Africa, Germany, Kenya, Netherlands, and Brazil.

We use welcoming and open channels for community participation. We have a cohort-based Slack channel and a public-facing Gitter channel (details: https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#resources). We strive to avoid jargon and other non-inclusive languages that can alienate, and make underrepresented people feel excluded. We use simple and jargon-free English in our communications, website and training resources (see an example from one of the cohort calls: https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/week04/). On our website, pronouns are listed for every participant in their profile (https://openlifesci.org/ols-1/projects-participants/#participants). At the beginning of each cohort call, we remind our [Code of Conduct](https://openlifesci.org/code-of-conduct) and use roll call where participants are asked to list their names and pronouns so others address them respectfully. We encourage and recognize the quietest voices, and not just those with the most confidence, and volume. During the cohort calls, we facilitate breakout discussions and encourage silent note-taking in shared notes. In OLS-2, cohort calls are live-transcribed using [Otter.ai](https://otter.ai), and some breakout rooms are non-verbal, to ensure that people with varying language skills or ability can still get an interactive and full experience. 

We are still learning and are extremely grateful for the community members for sharing their experiences and resources with us to improve accessibility in the program. Over the last year, we’ve grown massively, from a hopeful idea co-founded by three people who set out to organise this program backed by their extremely generous and inspiring Open Science friends as mentors and experts. That idea has evolved into a thriving open science community - weekly emails to our 32 OLS-2 projects and mentors lists reaches over 100 people, and Zoom cohort calls now boast 40+ participants, despite being staggered across different times of day to accommodate time zones across the six different continents. In addition to the countries in OLS-1, OLS-2 participants  also represent Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mali, New Zealand, Nigeria, Switzerland, Turkey, and Uganda in our cohort.

### Timeline of organisation support and partnerships

The project has been supported by many organisations that have helped promote the program in their network allowing access to a wider research community (see here: https://openlifesci.org/about#partners-and-sponsors). 

- **November 2019**: Non-financial partnership from Mozilla Open Leaders, Backofen Lab, Software Sustainability Institute, ELIXIR, de.NBI, EMBL Bio-IT, Freiburg University, Manchester University. These partnerships represented our employers, advisors, and professional networks - no official partnership agreements or memorandum of understanding was signed. 
- **June 2020**: ‘OLS-2 for Turing’ collaboration with _The Turing Way_ to support Open Source projects from The Alan Turing Institute and The Turing Way community
- **August 2020**: OLS was awarded the EOSC-Life Training grant to build a cohort with the EOSC Research Infrastructure community in **2021**
- **August 2020**: OLS registers as a Limited company with **£1 (GBP 1) in assets**
- **May-September 2020**: Software Sustainability Institute Fellowship pays for OLS-2 communication platform cost and mentorship training by [360 Training UK](http://360training.co.uk/) 

Bonus trivia before we finish the first part of our report: In July 2020, OLS was also shortlisted as one of the two projects as “best innovation in Open Source Technology” by CogX - a global festival for AI and technology (https://cogx.co/cogx-awards/cogx-awards-2020-shortlisted/). Though we did not win the award, we attracted the attention of early stage researchers interested in building their projects on AI and data science.
