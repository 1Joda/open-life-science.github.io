# A mentoring program for Open Science ambassadors in Life Science

**Purpose**: Training for early stage researchers and young leaders interested in furthering their
Open Science skills

**Outcome**: Ambassadors for Open Science practice, training and education across multiple European
and international bioinformatics communities.

**Process**: A 12-week mentoring program, based on the [Mozilla Open Leader program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/), helping participants in becoming Open Leaders by using three principles:

1. **Sharing** essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Source project.
2. **Connecting** members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by creating space in this program for them to share their experiences and expertise.
3. **Empowering** them to become effective Open Science Leaders in their communities as ambassadors for Open Science practices.

## Values

We want to make this program mutually beneficial for all the participants.
Here are a few values we think you will receive from participating in this project.

- Become a member of the community
- Exchange skills and build your profiles
- Highlight your resources by sharing with the community
- Collaborate with others in Open Science projects
- Develop projects to publish online
- Participate in designing this program by sharing your feedback and experience
- Gain insights from other experts in the field
- Gain recognition and acknowledgement for your work

## Timeline

- **October 2019**: Opening of the applications
- **End of November 2019**: Closing of the applications
- **Mid of December 2019**: Successful applicants announced
- **January 2020**: Start of the 12-week program

  A detailed schedule of the program is available in the [syllabus](syllabus#schedule).

## The program itself

To illustrate the program, we will share the persona/story of Joy, a mentee participating in the program, and Sam, their [personal mentor](about#mentors), as they progress through their open leadership journey. They will be involved in the following steps of this program:
1. In their applications, they will indicate their interests in the topics related to Open Science and education in bioinformatics. Joy will provide a short outline of their project, and Sam will list their expertise that they want to share with their mentee.
2. Based on their common interests, they will be introduced to each other as suitable mentee and mentor.
3. A first cohort call will be scheduled where Joy will get to know all the participants of the program, present their project, and learn about others' projects.
4. Relevant contents related to Open Life Science and education will be selected to design a 12-week program similar to the previous [Mozilla Open Leader](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) programs. These contents will be shared and discussed in the following bi-weekly online calls:
    1. In the cohort calls, the program leaders will introduce new topics and resources, facilitate break-out discussions, and invite [expert](about#experts) from the field to give talks.
    2. In mentors-only calls, Sam will participate in topic-based discussions with other mentors aimed at enhancing their mentoring skills.
    3. In mentee-mentor calls, Sam will help Joy evaluate their understanding of the new topics, and review their progress by providing constructive feedback. Joy will be given relevant exercises before these calls to help them apply new skills in their project.
5. When needed, Joy and Sam will be able to connect with other [experts](about#experts) and get consulted on their project.
6. A final cohort call will allow Joy to present their project to other participants and exchange values.
7. A self-evaluation survey will help Joy and Sam in positioning their knowledge in open leadership before and after the program.
8. For the next round, Joy will share what they learnt by [mentoring](about#mentors) a project and Sam will become an [expert](about#experts).

## Applications

This program will focus on open science and education in the life sciences and bioinformatics domains.

We are particularly keen to connect with the participants from less-represented European countries such as Hungary, Greece, Estonia, and Cyprus. We also invite applicants from outside Europe, particularly from developing countries (e.g. India and Africa - who are also timezone-compatible).

Cohort calls will be conducted in English. However, our participants who have different primary languages such as Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and Portuguese, will be paired with mentors who can communicate in their preferred languages.

**Interested to participate? The application will open in October.**
