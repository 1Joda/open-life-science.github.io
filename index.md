# A mentoring & training program for Open Science ambassadors in Life Science

The Open Life Science program helps **early stage researchers and potential academic leaders** in becoming **Open Science ambassadors**.

Through **personal mentorship and cohort-based training**, participants of this **15-week program**:
- learn essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project
- connect with members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by sharing their experiences and expertise
- are empowered to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities.

We are recruiting for our first cohort to start in January 2020, but also mentors and experts.

## Projects

Participants come to this program with a project in mind. The project doesn't have to be technical — it can be a curriculum (open educational resource), an open data project or report, an open source software project, open publication, community/team culture movements, or anything else that:

- supports openness in life science
- has something to work on (a feature, module, or minimum viable product) during the program
- allows and welcomes contributions by others

Whether the project is just an idea at this stage or something that's been running for years, all applications are welcome.

*You are not sure about your idea? We shared some potential projects in a [dedicated story]({% link _posts/2019-10-18-projects.md %}) and will organize a pre-application webinar in November (details will be shared soon).*

## Values

We want to make this program mutually beneficial for all the participants.
Here are a few values we think you will receive from participating in this project.

- Become a member of the community
- Exchange skills and build your profiles
- Highlight your resources by sharing with the community
- Collaborate with others in Open Science projects
- Develop projects to publish online
- Participate in designing this program by sharing your feedback and experience
- Gain insights from other experts in the field
- Gain recognition and acknowledgement for your work

## Timeline

{% include _includes/timeline.md %}

  A detailed schedule of the program is available in the [syllabus](syllabus#schedule).

## The program itself

*To illustrate the program, we will share the persona/story of Joy, a mentee participating in the program, and Sam, their [personal mentor](about#mentors), as they progress through their open science journey.*

In their applications, they will indicate their interests in the topics related to Open Science in bioinformatics. Joy will provide a short outline of their project, and Sam will list their expertise that they want to share with their mentee.

After the selection process, they will be involved in the following steps of this program:

1. Based on their common interests, they will be introduced to each other as suitable mentee and mentor

    They will meet every 2 weeks. In these **mentee-mentor calls** (around 30 minutes), Sam will help Joy evaluate their understanding of the new topics, and review their progress by providing constructive feedback. Joy will be given relevant exercises before these calls to help them apply new skills in their project. When needed, Joy and Sam will be able to connect with other [experts](about#experts) and get consulted on their project.

2. Joy will participate to online calls where [relevant contents related to Open Life Science](syllabus#schedule) is shared and discussed with all participants of the program. 

    In these **cohort calls**, the program leaders will introduce new topics and resources, facilitate break-out discussions, and invite [expert](about#experts) from the field to give talks. In the first call Joy will get to know all the participants of the program, present their project, learn about others' projects. A final cohort call will allow Joy to present their project to other participants and exchange values.

3. Sam will participate to **mentoring training** with topic-based discussions with other mentors aimed at enhancing their mentoring skills.

After the 14 weeks of the program, a self-evaluation survey will help Joy and Sam in positioning their knowledge in open science leadership before and after the program.

For the next round, Joy may share what they learnt by [mentoring](about#mentors) a project and Sam continue their mentor effort and/or become an [expert](about#experts).

## Applications

This program will focus on Open Science in the life sciences and bioinformatics domains.

We are particularly keen to connect with the participants from less-represented European countries such as Hungary, Greece, Estonia, and Cyprus. We also invite applicants from outside Europe, particularly from developing countries (e.g. India and Africa - who are also timezone-compatible).

Cohort calls will be conducted in English. However, our participants who have different primary languages such as Spanish, French, German, Hindi, and Portuguese, will be paired with mentors who can communicate in their preferred languages.

**Interested to participate? The application will be open from Oct 25 to Dec 8, 2019.**
