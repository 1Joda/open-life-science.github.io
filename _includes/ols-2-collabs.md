## OLS-2 for Turing

Under the collaboration name **OLS-2 for Turing**, Open Life Science has partnered with [_The Turing Way_](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way), a project within the [Tools, Practices and Systems Research Program](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) in  [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/).

This partnership will offer training and mentoring to interested members from Turing and _The Turing Way_ communities to join the second cohort (OLS-2) with individual or team projects and develop Open Science aspects in the projects that they either already have been working on, or want to develop in the near future.
Mentors will be preferably selected from The Alan Turing Institute but there will be a possibility to match projects with the right mentor from their current capacity. 
The roles and benefits for the participants and the eligibility of proposed projects will be as described for the main program.

Since this partnership was announced closer to the closing of the application call for OLS-2, we have extended the deadline for *OLS-2 for Turing** till **15 July 2020** to ensure that interested participants have sufficient time to discuss their plans with their supervisors within the organisation.
